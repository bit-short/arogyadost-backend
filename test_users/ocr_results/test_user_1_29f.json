Hyperchloremia also occurs when\ntoo much base is lost from the body (producing metabolic acidosis) or when a person hyperventilates (causing respiratory\nalkalosis). A decreased level of blood chloride (called hypochloremia) occurs with any disorder that causes low blood\nsodium. Hypochloremia also occurs with congestive heart failure, prolonged vomiting or gastric suction, Addison disease,\nemphysema or other chronic lung diseases (causing respiratory acidosis), and with loss of acid from the body (called\nmetabolic alkalosis).\nMethod : ION SELECTIVE ELECTRODE\nPlease correlate with clinical conditions.\nSample Collected on (SCT) : 26 Jul 2024 11:58\nSample Received on (SRT) : 26 Jul 2024 15:02\nReport Released on (RRT) : 26 Jul 2024 19:38\nSample Type : SERUM\nLabcode : [PHONE]/PE004 Dr Syeda Sumaiya MD(Path) Dr.Ashwin Mathew MD(Path)\nBarcode : CM731554\nPage : 13 of 18\nNote:- Underlined values are Critical Values, Clinician's attention required.

Because mild and\nmoderate kidney injury is poorly inferred from serum creatinine alone. Thus, it is recommended for clinical laboratories to routinely\nestimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a “gold standard” measurement for assessment of renal function, and report the value\nwhen serum creatinine is measured for patients 18 and older, when appropriate and feasible. It cannot be measured easily in\nclinical practice, instead, GFR is estimated from equations using serum creatinine, age, race and sex. This provides easy to\ninterpret information for the doctor and patient on the degree of renal impairment since it approximately equates to the\npercentage of kidney function remaining. Application of CKD-EPI equation together with the other diagnostic tools in renal\nmedicine will further improve the detection and management of patients with CKD.\nReference\nLevey AS, Stevens LA, Schmid CH, Zhang YL, Castro AF, 3rd, Feldman HI, et al.
