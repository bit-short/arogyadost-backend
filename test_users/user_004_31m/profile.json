Because mild\nand moderate kidney injury is poorly inferred from serum creatinine alone. Thus, it is recommended for clinical\nlaboratories to routinely estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a “gold standard” measurement for assessment of\nrenal function, and report the value when serum creatinine is measured for patients 18 and older, when appropriate\nand feasible. It cannot be measured easily in clinical practice, instead, GFR is estimated from equations using serum\ncreatinine, age, race and sex. This provides easy to interpret information for the doctor and patient on the degree of\nrenal impairment since it approximately equates to the percentage of kidney function remaining. Application of\nCKD-EPI equation together with the other diagnostic tools in renal medicine will further improve the detection and\nmanagement of patients with CKD.\nReference\nLevey AS, Stevens LA, Schmid CH, Zhang YL, Castro AF, 3rd, Feldman HI, et al.

Ref. Interval. :-\n1.90 - 3.10 mg/dL\nClinical significance:\nMagnesium is the fourth most abundant cation in the body and second most prevalent intracellular cation. The total body\nmagnesium content is about 25 g or approximately 1 mol, of which 55% reside in the skeleton. About 45% of the magnesium is\nintracellular. In general higher the metabolic activity of cell, the greater is its magnesium content. Magnesium is a cofactor for\nmore than 300 enzymes in the body.\nDisorders of magnesium metabolism are separated into those causing hypomagnesaemia/magnesium deficiencies and\nhypermagnesemia. Hypomagnesaemia is common in patient in hospitals. Moderate to severe deficiency of magnesium is usually\ndue to loss of magnesium from the gastrointestinal (gi) tract or kidneys. One of the more serious complications of magnesium\ndeficiency is cardiac arrhythmia. Symptomatic hypermagnsemia is almost always caused by excessive intake, resulting from\nadministration of antacids, enemas, and parenteral fluids containing magnesium. Depression of neuromuscular system is the most\ncommon manifestation of magnesium intoxication.\nExternal quality control program participation:\nCollege Of American Pathologists: Chemistry survey; CAP Number: 7193855-01\nPlease correlate with clinical conditions.\nMethod:- MODIFIED XYLIDYL BLUE REACTION METHOD\nSample Collected on (SCT) : 28 Feb 2025 12:52\nSample Received on (SRT) : 28 Feb 2025 15:11\nReport Released on (RRT) : 28 Feb 2025 17:54\nSample Type : SERUM\nLabcode : [PHONE]/DG007 Dr Syeda Sumaiya MD(Path) Dr.Ashwin Mathew MD(Path)\nBarcode : DF201065 Page : 12 of 16\nNote:- Underlined values are Critical Values, Clinician's attention required.

Because mild and\nmoderate kidney injury is poorly inferred from serum creatinine alone. Thus, it is recommended for clinical laboratories to routinely\nestimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a “gold standard” measurement for assessment of renal function, and report the value\nwhen serum creatinine is measured for patients 18 and older, when appropriate and feasible. It cannot be measured easily in\nclinical practice, instead, GFR is estimated from equations using serum creatinine, age, race and sex. This provides easy to\ninterpret information for the doctor and patient on the degree of renal impairment since it approximately equates to the\npercentage of kidney function remaining. Application of CKD-EPI equation together with the other diagnostic tools in renal\nmedicine will further improve the detection and management of patients with CKD.\nReference\nLevey AS, Stevens LA, Schmid CH, Zhang YL, Castro AF, 3rd, Feldman HI, et al.

Because mild and\nmoderate kidney injury is poorly inferred from serum creatinine alone. Thus, it is recommended for clinical laboratories to routinely\nestimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a “gold standard” measurement for assessment of renal function, and report the value\nwhen serum creatinine is measured for patients 18 and older, when appropriate and feasible. It cannot be measured easily in\nclinical practice, instead, GFR is estimated from equations using serum creatinine, age, race and sex. This provides easy to\ninterpret information for the doctor and patient on the degree of renal impairment since it approximately equates to the\npercentage of kidney function remaining. Application of CKD-EPI equation together with the other diagnostic tools in renal\nmedicine will further improve the detection and management of patients with CKD.\nReference\nLevey AS, Stevens LA, Schmid CH, Zhang YL, Castro AF, 3rd, Feldman HI, et al.
